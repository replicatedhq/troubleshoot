# 🧠 Intelligent Analysis Demo with Ollama

This demo showcases how the **Agent-Based Analysis** system enhances traditional Kubernetes troubleshooting with AI-powered insights using Ollama.

## 🎯 What This Demonstrates

### Traditional Analysis (Local Agent)
```
❌ FAIL - Pod Status Check
   Message: Pod web-app-7c8b9d4f2-xyz12 has restart count 15
```

### 🧠 Intelligent Analysis (Ollama Agent)
```
❌ FAIL - Pod Status Check
   🔍 Analysis: Memory pressure causing OOMKills due to undersized limits
   🎯 Confidence: 92.5%
   📈 Impact: High - Application availability affected
   🎯 Root Cause: Memory limit 256Mi vs usage 245Mi (95.7% utilization)
   🛠️  Remediation: Increase Memory Limits
   💻 Commands: kubectl patch deployment web-app -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"web-container","resources":{"limits":{"memory":"512Mi"}}}]}}}}'
```

## 🚀 Quick Demo

Run the demonstration:

```bash
./run-demo.sh
```

This shows sample analysis output comparing traditional vs. intelligent analysis.

## 🔧 Full Interactive Demo

To run with real Ollama analysis:

### 1. Install Ollama
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Or visit https://ollama.ai for other options
```

### 2. Start Ollama & Pull Model
```bash
# Start Ollama server
ollama serve

# Pull the CodeLlama model (in another terminal)
ollama pull codellama:13b
```

### 3. Run Full Demo
```bash
go run demo-ollama-analysis.go
```

## 📊 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: CPU Pressure & Resource Exhaustion
- **Location**: `sample-support-bundles/cpu-pressure/`
- **Issues**: High CPU usage, OOMKilled pods, scheduling failures
- **Intelligence**: Identifies monitoring agent consuming 640% of CPU limit as root cause

### Scenario 2: Application CrashLoop BackOff
- **Location**: `sample-support-bundles/crashloop-issue/`
- **Issues**: Pod failing to start, dependency connection errors
- **Intelligence**: Discovers service namespace mismatches causing startup failures

## 🧠 Intelligence Advantages

| Feature | Traditional Analysis | Intelligent Analysis |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Root Cause** | ❌ Basic symptoms only | ✅ Deep causal analysis |
| **Remediation** | ❌ Generic suggestions | ✅ Specific commands |
| **Correlation** | ❌ Isolated issues | ✅ Cross-component insights |
| **Context** | ❌ Raw data only | ✅ Explained relationships |
| **Confidence** | ❌ No reliability score | ✅ AI confidence ratings |
