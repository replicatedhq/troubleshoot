# Consolidated Troubleshoot CLI

## Goals

As Troubleshoot grows and gains new features, some of which involves flags for setting options, and to make it easier to add additional subcommands that don't belong underneath either `support-bundle` or `preflight` binaries, we would like to consolidate all of the Troubleshoot commands under one binary.

There is discussion about changing the behaviour of `preflight`, considering that preflights and support-bundles utilize the same specs - the same collectors and analyzers - and only differ in what is returned to the user post-analysis.  For this design proposal, `support-bundle` and `preflight` may be condensed into a single `troubleshoot` binary.

For the purposes of this design we'll talk about troubleshoot as a standalone binary. It will also be available, and likley most commonly installed as, a krew plugin for kubectl.

## Non-Goals

## Background

## High Level Design

Functions of `support-bundle`, `preflight`, `analyze`, `redact`, and `sbctl` binaries/tools should be rolled together into a single `troubleshoot` CLI that can perform all necessary functions of the same.

`troubleshoot` CLI should be able to report on the version that is installed in the CLI, and any support bundle generated with `troubleshoot` should report its build/version inside the archive it generates.

## Detailed Design

In the interest of being able to work on this quickly without breaking existing use-cases, a new `troubleshoot` command should be created. Utilizing cobra and viper best practices from the cobra.dev docs.

A guiding principle of this redesign should be that the we are defining a set of "artefacts" (i.e: a support bundle, a spec), and each of the defined public functions acts as an interface to interact with these artefacts. either creating, manipulating, or performing other actions on them. in this way we guarantee that each public function can be re-used on an artefact (support bundle) in any stage of it's existance.

For example, running a set of redactors or analyzers on an existing support bundle without having to re-run collection.

### sbctl â†’ troubleshoot inspect

sbctl should be migrated to the troubleshoot repository in a "lift and shift" operation to start with.

It should continue to be built as a standalone binary to enable continued use until a stable replacement exists. as such it should me integrated in a way that preserves the existing `cmd` and it's package requirements.

Once integrated into the repository, we can begin using functions from it's packages from the from the new `troubleshoot` command to enable the `inspect` subcommand.

### Public APIs

The existing package entrypoint we use from the support-bundle command is `supportbundle.CollectSupportBundleFromSpec()`
which is an end-to-end function that runs collectors, redactors and then analysis.

The Consolidated cli should be responsible for handling the end-to-end running of this process in the `cmd` leaving the importable packages free to focus on defining the individual collect, redact analyze steps.

To this end we should create a new `pkg` that targets the functionality provided by the `collect` and `analyze` packages such as `collect.runHostCollectors()` and provide a stable API to be used by the CLI and other projects. At the same time we can unpublish functionality that should not be exposed (such as the individual collector and analyser functions) and mark code for deprecation.

This new package should be kept as minimal as possible. and serve only as an interface to private functions in the other packages.

Once the stable API is ready we can instruct projects like kurl to target that and work on removing code marked for deprecation and migrate non-public functions to an `internal` package to make it clear that it's not intended to be imported.

The core of this api will be exposed via new troubleshoot `types`

#### Conventions
* Interfaces instead of concrete types: Where possible, prefer using interfaces that concrete types implement. This abstraction allows us to
  * Create clear API contracts and separation of concerns e.g A `collect.Collect` interface only collects information from various sources into a bundle. The implementor (can implement several interfaces) has to abide to this contract and the consumer expects the contract to be held.
  * Extensibility: Extending or even replacing concrete type implementations is now possible when the public APIs are defined as interfaces. This gives us the ability to maintain the project with minimal risk of introducing breaking changes. It also allows us to have the flexibility of introducing concepts such as plugins in the future.
  * Testability of public APIs: With interfaces, we are able to test our contracts with ease cause we are able to create stubs we can build our tests on.

Below are the proposed APIs

*Types*
```go
// TroubleshootKinds wraps all kinds defined by troubleshoot
type TroubleshootKinds struct {
    AnalyzersV1Beta2        []troubleshootv1beta2.Analyzer
    CollectorsV1Beta2       []troubleshootv1beta2.Collector
    HostCollectorsV1Beta2   []troubleshootv1beta2.HostCollector
    HostPreflightsV1Beta2   []troubleshootv1beta2.HostPreflight

    RemoteCollectorsV1Beta2 []troubleshootv1beta2.RemoteCollector
    SupportBundlesV1Beta2   []troubleshootv1beta2.SupportBundle
    // Any future kinds e.g AnalyzersV1 would end up here
}

// To Allow for forward compatibility while reducing the impact of potentially breaking changes, options will be passed into these methods via options structs.
type LoadOptions struct {
    RawSpecs []string // list of locations for specs to load
    RawSpec string // a single spec to parse
    FilePaths []string // list of filepaths to check, can be globbed
    URIs []string // list of URIs to retrieve specs from
    SearchCluster bool // toggle for searching cluster from context for troubleshoot objects
    ProgressChan chan // a channel to write progress information to
}

type LoadBundleOptions struct {
    Path string // Path to archive or directory of bundle files
}

type CollectOptions struct {
    Specs *TroubleshootKinds // list of specs to extract collectors and redactors from
    ProgressChan chan // a channel to write progress information to
}

type RedactOptions struct {
    Specs *TroubleshootKinds // list of specs to extract redactors from
    ProgressChan chan // a channel to write progress information to
}
// Note: this is almost identical to `CollectOptions` for now but remains separate to enable easier addition of redact specific options at a later date

type AnalyzeOptions struct {
    ProgressChan chan // a channel to write progress information to
}

type ServeOptions struct {
    Address string // address to listen on including port (0.0.0.0:8080)
    ConfigPath string // optional path to store generated kubeconfig
}

type SaveAnalysisOptions struct {
    Format string // format to save analysis in: json/yaml/csv/plaintext
    Path string // where to save the analysis output (default to Bundle.FilePath)
}

type AnalysisResults struct {
    Bundle Bundle // include bundle metadata
}
```

*Interfaces*
```go
// Bundler interface implements all functionality related to managing troubleshoot bundles
type Bundler interface {
    // Collect runs collections defined in TroubleshootKinds passed through CollectOptions
    Collect(CollectOptions) (error) {}

    // We need to expose the bundle data collected in some form of structure as well
    // We have https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/blob/620fa75eb593247a07c4dc39ea96fc6a059be111/pkg/collect/result.go#L15 at the moment

    // Analyze runs analysis defined in TroubleshootKinds passed through AnalyzeOptions
    Analyze(AnalyzeOptions) (AnalysisResults, error) {}

    // AnalyzeResults contains the analysis results that the bundle has
    AnalyzeResults() AnalysisResults

    // Redact runs redaction defined in TroubleshootKinds passed through RedactOptions
    Redact(RedactOptions) error {}

    // Archive produces an archive from a bundle on disk with options passed in ArchiveOptions
    Archive(ArchiveOptions) error {}

    // Load loads a bundle from a directory or archive served from disk or a remote location like a URL
    Load(LoadBundleOptions) (error) {}
    // it's worth noting that while this may appear inefficient now
    // it allows us to extend what we include in the Bundle struct in future without having to continuously extend the load function.

    // Serve starts an sbctl-like server with options defined in ServeOptions
    Serve(ServeOptions) error {}

}
```

*functions*

```go
// Load loads specs defined by the LoadOptions struct and returns a TroubleshootKinds object
func Load(LoadOptions) (TroubleshootKinds, error){}
```

With the above definitions, an example of generating a supoprt bundle:

```go
// convenience function so we don't have to type "if err != nil" a thousand times
func check(err error) {
  if err != nil {
    log.Panic(err)
  }
}

// define where we want our specs to be loaded from
loadOptions := LoadOptions{
  URIs: ["https://some.url/spec.yaml"],
  SearchCluster: true,
}

// load our specs and parse them into TroubleshootKinds
kinds, err := Load(LoadOptions)
check(err)

// Add defaults that the application implements (e.g support-bundle, preflights, some other project)
// Pre-populated somewhere in the application's project code. Constant? Dynamically loaded from config ??
// KOTS for example has default specs in its codebase - https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots/tree/main/pkg/supportbundle
// Troubleshoot has default redactors - https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/blob/620fa75eb593247a07c4dc39ea96fc6a059be111/pkg/redact/redact.go#L161
defaults := TroubleshootKinds{}
defaults.CollectorsV1Beta2 = append(kinds.CollectorsV1Beta2, other.CollectorsV1Beta2...)
defaults.AnalyzersV1Beta2 = append(kinds.CollectorsV1Beta2, other.AnalyzersV1Beta2...)
defaults.RedactorsV1Beta2 = append(kinds.CollectorsV1Beta2, other.RedactorsV1Beta2...)

// Add them to the loaded specs
kinds := TroubleshootKinds{}
kinds.Add(defaults)

// define our options for collection
collectOptions := CollectOptions{
    Specs := *kinds,
}

// Implements the Bundler interface which
type bundle struct {
  FilePath string
}

// declare our new bundle
var newBundle bundle
// run collection for our bundle
err := newBundle.Collect(collectOptions)
check(err)

// now we can run analysis on our bundle
AnalysisResults,err := newBundle.Analyze(nil) // a nil AnalyzeOptions dictates that we want to adhere to the passed spec and _only_ to the spec. (no defaults)
// from here we can format and display the results however we want or create an archive of the bundle to share / download.
```


### Usage patterns

- generate a support bundle

  `troubleshoot collect supportbundle.yaml`

  `troubleshoot collect supportbundle.yaml secrets/default/kotsadm-appslug-supportbundle`

  `troubleshoot collect https://kots.io`

- if no bundle URI/location is specified, search for a spec in-cluster

  `troubleshoot collect`

- use a spec to return a go/no-go preflight outcome

  `troubleshoot preflight spec.yaml`

  This should not only clearly state any reasons for failing, but also use standardised exit codes that can be used by automation tools.

  We should also continue to accept standard in, accepting any preflights from a yaml multidoc.

  `helm template | troubleshoot preflight -`

- Interact with an existing support bundle with kubectl.

  `troubleshoot inspect support-bundle-12-12-2001.tar.gz`

  This should set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable, as well as a `TROUBLESHOOT_SHELL` environment variable before spawning a subshell.
  This is to allow prompts and shell environments to be able to detect that they're running in a troubleshoot spawned shell, much like tmux et-al.

  Alternatively the `--interactive=false` global flag will disable the spawning of a nested shell.
  this should behave much like the `sbctl serve` command does today,
  printing the path to it's temporary kubeconfig location to stdout. optionally taking flags to specify the kubeconfig location for use in advanced automation.

  `troubleshoot inspect --interactive=false support-bundle-12-12-2001.tar.gz`

  `troubleshoot inspect --interactive=false -o /path/to/kubeconfig support-bundle-12-12-2001.tar.gz`

- Redact an existing spec

  `troubleshoot redact -f redactors.yaml support-bundle.tar.gz`

- Re-run analysers against an existing support bundle

  `troubleshoot analyze -f spec.yaml support-bundle.tar.gz`
