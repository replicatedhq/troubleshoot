# Consolidated Troubleshoot CLI

## Goals

As Troubleshoot grows and gains new features, some of which involves flags for setting options, and to make it easier to add additional subcommands that don't belong underneath either `support-bundle` or `preflight` binaries, we would like to consolidate all of the Troubleshoot commands under one binary.

There is discussion about changing the behaviour of `preflight`, considering that preflights and support-bundles utilize the same specs - the same collectors and analyzers - and only differ in what is returned to the user post-analysis.  For this design proposal, `support-bundle` and `preflight` may be condensed into a single `troubleshoot` binary.

For the purposes of this design we'll talk about troubleshoot as a standalone binary. It will also be available, and likley most commonly installed as, a krew plugin for kubectl.

## Non-Goals

## Background

## High Level Design

Functions of `support-bundle`, `preflight`, `analyze`, `redact`, and `sbctl` binaries/tools should be rolled together into a single `troubleshoot` CLI that can perform all necessary functions of the same.

`troubleshoot` CLI should be able to report on the version that is installed in the CLI, and any support bundle generated with `troubleshoot` should report its build/version inside the archive it generates.

## Detailed Design

In the interest of being able to work on this quickly without breaking existing use-cases, a new `troubleshoot` command should be created. Utilizing cobra and viper best practices from the cobra.dev docs.

A guiding principle of this redesign should be that the we are defining a set of "artefacts" (i.e: a support bundle, a spec), and each of the defined public functions acts as an interface to interact with these artefacts. either creating, manipulating, or performing other actions on them. in this way we guarantee that each public function can be re-used on an artefact (support bundle) in any stage of it's existance.

For example, running a set of redactors or analyzers on an existing support bundle without having to re-run collection.

### sbctl â†’ troubleshoot inspect

sbctl should be migrated to the troubleshoot repository in a "lift and shift" operation to start with.

It should continue to be built as a standalone binary to enable continued use until a stable replacement exists. as such it should me integrated in a way that preserves the existing `cmd` and it's package requirements.

Once integrated into the repository, we can begin using functions from it's packages from the from the new `troubleshoot` command to enable the `inspect` subcommand.

### Public APIs

The existing package entrypoint we use from the support-bundle command is `supportbundle.CollectSupportBundleFromSpec()`
which is an end-to-end function that runs collectors, redactors and then analysis.

The Consolidated cli should be responsible for handling the end-to-end running of this process in the `cmd` leaving the importable packages free to focus on defining the individual collect, redact analyze steps.

To this end we should create a new `pkg` that targets the functionality provided by the `collect` and `analyze` packages such as `collect.runHostCollectors()` and provide a stable API to be used by the CLI and other projects. At the same time we can unpublish functionality that should not be exposed (such as the individual collector and analyser functions) and mark code for deprecation.

This new package should be kept as minimal as possible. and serve only as an interface to private functions in the other packages.

Once the stable API is ready we can instruct projects like kurl to target that and work on removing code marked for deprecation and migrate non-public functions to an `internal` package to make it clear that it's not intended to be imported.

The functionality we want to expose via this api is:

- `CollectBundle(context.Context, opt CollectOptions) (bundlePath string, error)`
  - collect a support bundle from a spec.
  - takes a parsed spec struct as an parameter.
  - returns a path to the bundle directory and errors.
  - to minimise IO and increase collection speed. redactors should be run inline, redacting data in memory before it's saved to a bundle.
- `RedactBundle(context.Context, opt RedactOptions) error`
  - redact an already collected bundle, takes a path to the bundle as an parameter.
  - returns any errors
- `AnalyzeBundle(context.Context, opt AnalyzeOptions) (results{},error)`
  - run analysers from the spec and return the analysis results struct
  - returns analysis struct and errors
- `ArchiveBundle(context.Context, opt ArchiveOptions) error`
  - generates a tar archive of the bundle directory at the specified path with optional compression
  - takes bundle path, compression method and destination as parameters.
  - returns errors
- `ServeBundle(context.Context, opt ServeOptions)`
  - starts a sbctl server using the specified bundle and port, outputting a kubeconfig at a specified location.
- `LoadSpecs(context.Context, opt LoadOptions) ([]TroubleShootKind,err)`
  - Takes a loadOptions struct and returns a list of parsed troubleshoot kinds.


Some examples of the options structs.

```go
type LoadOptions struct {
  RawSpecs []string // list of locations for specs to load
  RawSpec string // a single spec to parse
  FilePaths []string // list of filepaths to check, can be globbed
  URIs []string // list of URIs to retrieve specs from
  SearchCluster bool // toggle for searching cluster from context for troubleshoot objects
}
```

```go
type CollectOptions struct {
  Specs []TroubleshootKind // list of specs to extract collectors and redactors from
}
```

```go
type RedactOptions struct {
  Specs []troubleshootKind // list of specs to extract redactors from
}
```
Note: this is almost identical to `CollectOptions` for now but remains separate to enable easier addition of redact specific options at a later date

```go
type ServeOptions struct {
  Address string // address to listen on including port (0.0.0.0:8080)
  ConfigPath string // optional path to store generated kubeconfig
}
```


### Usage patterns

- generate a support bundle

  `troubleshoot collect supportbundle.yaml`

  `troubleshoot collect supportbundle.yaml secrets/default/kotsadm-appslug-supportbundle`

  `troubleshoot collect https://kots.io`

- if no bundle URI/location is specified, search for a spec in-cluster

  `troubleshoot collect`

- use a spec to return a go/no-go preflight outcome

  `troubleshoot preflight spec.yaml`

  This should not only clearly state any reasons for failing, but also use standardised exit codes that can be used by automation tools.

  We should also continue to accept standard in, accepting any preflights from a yaml multidoc.

  `helm template | troubleshoot preflight -`

- Interact with an existing support bundle with kubectl.

  `troubleshoot inspect support-bundle-12-12-2001.tar.gz`

  This should set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable, as well as a `TROUBLESHOOT_SHELL` environment variable before spawning a subshell.
  This is to allow prompts and shell environments to be able to detect that they're running in a troubleshoot spawned shell, much like tmux et-al.

  Alternatively the `--interactive=false` global flag will disable the spawning of a nested shell.
  this should behave much like the `sbctl serve` command does today,
  printing the path to it's temporary kubeconfig location to stdout. optionally taking flags to specify the kubeconfig location for use in advanced automation.

  `troubleshoot inspect --interactive=false support-bundle-12-12-2001.tar.gz`

  `troubleshoot inspect --interactive=false -o /path/to/kubeconfig support-bundle-12-12-2001.tar.gz`

- Redact an existing spec

  `troubleshoot redact -f redactors.yaml support-bundle.tar.gz`

- Re-run analysers against an existing support bundle

  `troubleshoot analyze -f spec.yaml support-bundle.tar.gz`
